## Installation
You could just download the project and open **index.html** file and you are all set!<br>
<br>
However if you want to have a greater development experience, I **strongly recommend** you to do the following:
1. Dowload and install Node from [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Install the **npx** util by running the following command:
```
$ npm i -g npx
```
Now, you can go to the root of your project and launch the project with command:
```
$ npm start
```
